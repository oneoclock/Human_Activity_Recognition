# Human_Activity_Recognition
This project makes use of sensor data placed all over a volunteers house to determine/predict his next activity. The data used is collected from a number of houses where sensors were equipped. 
A neural network is used in this project to predict a person's activity.

This project also compares the prediction accuracy with a logistic regression model.

An application of this project is to make smart homes smarter by actually recognizing activities performed by the person keeping in mind factors such as time, light, presence etc.
